## What I learned / improved from this project

- How to increment likes using a counter and update the count in the DOM.
- I learned about the .toLocaleString() method in order to get commas to appear for numbers in the thousands (for the likes)
- I got some practice translating a design from Figma into code

## What I could improve

- I could render the card data from the posts.js instead of typing it into the HTML.
  I could refactor some of the JavaScript functions. I should only have one main increment function instead of individual increment functions for each post.
